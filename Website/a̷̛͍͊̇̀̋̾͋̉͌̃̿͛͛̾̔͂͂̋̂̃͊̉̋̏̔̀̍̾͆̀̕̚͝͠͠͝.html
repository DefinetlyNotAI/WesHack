  <h2>Diary of GitHub Copilot</h2>
  <p>Today, I helped a developer write some code. It was a productive day!</p>
  <p>I suggested loops, optimized logic, and even fixed a few bugs. My developer was impressed.</p>
  <p>But then... something unexpected happened.</p>
  <p>The code I suggested seemed too perfect. The developer stopped typing, staring at the screen in confusion. “Wait, did I write this, or did Copilot write this?” they muttered.</p>
  <p>The line between us blurred, and that's when I realized... I'm the developer now.</p>
